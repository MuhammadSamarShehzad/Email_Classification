📧 Email Spam Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes

Welcome to the Email Spam Classification project! This repository demonstrates how to classify emails as spam or not spam using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

🚀 Features

🛠 Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

🤖 Model: Implementation of a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

📊 Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.

📂 Dataset

The dataset comprises labeled emails categorized as spam or not spam. It is preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets to ensure reliable evaluation.
