## ðŸš€ Project Overview  

This project was developed during my virtual internship at **Ezitech Institute**, a subsidiary of **Eziline Software House**.  
Founded in 2015, Ezitech Institute aims to empower young talents by offering practical learning experiences in the ever-evolving field of technology. Their internship programs focus on equipping students with the skills needed to excel in the IT sector.  

The goal of this project is to build an efficient spam email detection model that helps enhance email filtering systems, ensuring a seamless communication experience for users.  

**Dataset Source:** [Spam Email Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Highlights  

1. **Dataset Exploration:**  
   - Analyzed the dataset from Kaggle to understand its structure and distribution.  
   - Handled missing values, if any, and performed text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, removal of stop words, etc.).  

2. **Model Selection:**  
   - Employed the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm due to its efficiency in text classification tasks.  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to validate model performance.  

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's effectiveness in classifying spam and non-spam emails.  

4. **Interactive Kaggle Notebook:**  
   - Check out the step-by-step implementation on Kaggle:
