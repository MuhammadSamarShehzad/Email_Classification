![Spam Email Detection Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c914fc9-5c9d-4fab-b1a1-a428c6d54bfd)

Welcome to the **Spam Email Detection Project** â€” a machine learning solution to classify emails as spam or not using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

The goal of this project is to build an efficient, lightweight model to enhance email filtering systems, reducing spam and improving user productivity.

**Dataset Used:** [Spam Email Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email)

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **Python:** Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn:** For model training and evaluation
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Visual analysis and plotting

---

## ðŸ“‚ Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and tokenized text
   - Removed noise (stopwords, punctuations, etc.)

2. **Model Building:**
   - Utilized **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, ideal for text classification
   - Trained/test split to evaluate generalization

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

4. **Notebook Implementation:**
   - Explore full code on Kaggle:
